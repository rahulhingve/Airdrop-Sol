# Solana Airdrop & Send

Solana Airdrop & Send is a web application that allows users to claim free Solana (SOL) tokens and send SOL to other Solana addresses. The application is built using React, Framer Motion, and various Solana-related libraries.

## Features

- **Claim Free SOL**: Users can request an airdrop of SOL tokens by entering an amount and clicking the "Claim" button. The application will request an airdrop from the Solana network and update the user's balance accordingly.

- **Send SOL**: Users can send SOL to other Solana addresses by entering the recipient's public key and the amount to send. The application will create and send a transaction to the Solana network.

- **Wallet Connection**: The application integrates with the Solana Wallet Adapter, allowing users to connect their Solana wallets and interact with the application.

- **Signature Generation**: The application demonstrates how to sign a message using the user's Solana wallet. The generated signature can be copied to the clipboard.

- **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between a dark and light theme using the theme switch.

- **Notifications**: The application uses the `react-toastify` library to display notifications for successful and failed operations.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating animations and transitions in React applications.
- **Solana Web3.js**: The official Solana SDK for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- **Solana Wallet Adapter**: A library for integrating Solana wallets into web applications.
- **Lucide Icons**: A set of open-source feather-based icons used for the application's icons.
